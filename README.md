This is my Single Page Application. Implemented thanks to React and Redux.
We also used the React Router, Axios, Redux-thunk libraries.

You can take tests. Also, after authorization (you can write any email/password), access to the Create test tab will open. Where you can create your own tests, for this you need to fill in the Enter question field and answer options. You can go through them after that in the List question tab.

The application has a frontend and backend part thanks to Firebase.

Posted on Firebase hosting. The app is available at https://react-test-project-12422.web.app/
